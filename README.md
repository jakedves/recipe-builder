# RecipeBuilder
## What is it?

ReciperBuilder is an iOS application that allows users to create recipes easily and store them on their device for future reference. Featuring a simple UI designed with the Apple Human Interface Guidelines, this app is simple to use and fun to play with. The app allows users to build recipes, which feature recipe names, a list of ingredients, a list of instructions and an image they take of their recipe. Users can later edit these recipes and reference them when needed.

## Technologies I Learnt

- Swift 5
- SwiftUI 2 animations, transitions, modifiers, etc
- Core Data and CloudKit for recipe storage across devices
- UIKit View Controllers for implementing Camera and Photo Library support
- Using targets to control device-specific code
